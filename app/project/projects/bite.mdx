## About Bite

Bite is a recipe management app that solves a simple problem: losing recipes across Instagram saved posts, TikTok bookmarks, screenshots, and random websites. Instead of scattered recipes everywhere, Bite gives you one organized place for all your cooking inspirations.

## The Problem

As someone who cooks everyday and love trying new recipes online, I found myself constantly:

- Saving recipes to Instagram save posts only to scroll endlessly trying to find them
- Taking screenshots that get lost in my camera roll
- Bookmarking recipe sites I forget about
- Copying recipe URLs into random notes apps

There had to be a better way.

## The Solution

Bite lets you save recipes from anywhere using multiple methods:

1. **Screenshot/Photo import** - Upload recipe photos, AI extracts the content
2. **URL import** - Paste any recipe link from blogs or social media
3. **Text paste** - Copy/paste recipe text, AI structures it
4. **Manual entry** - Traditional recipe creation for family recipes

The AI automatically extracts:

- Recipe title and description
- Ingredient lists with quantities
- Step-by-step instructions
- Cooking times and servings

## Why I'm Building This

This is my personal project to:

1. Solve my own problem (I genuinely need this as a calorie-conscious eater who likes rotating recipes)
2. Learn the complete development cycle from building to deployment
3. Master modern tech stack (Next.js 15, Drizzle, Clerk, etc.)
4. Ship a complete product end-to-end

I'm documenting the entire journey in my blog - the wins, the challenges, the technical decisions.
